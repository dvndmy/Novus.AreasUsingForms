# Areas Calculator

This is a simple Windows Forms application called "Areas Calculator" implemented in C#. The program allows users to calculate the area and perimeter of different shapes, including a circle, rectangle, and triangle.

## Instructions

1. Run the program.
2. The program will display a user interface with input fields and buttons for different shapes.
3. To calculate the area and perimeter of a circle:
   - Enter the radius of the circle in the corresponding text box.
   - Click the "Calculate Circle" button.
   - The program will display the calculated perimeter and area of the circle.
4. To calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle:
   - Enter the width and height of the rectangle in the corresponding text boxes.
   - Click the "Calculate Rectangle" button.
   - The program will display the calculated area and perimeter of the rectangle.
5. To calculate the area and perimeter of a triangle:
   - Enter the lengths of all three sides of the triangle in the corresponding text boxes.
   - Click the "Calculate Triangle" button.
   - The program will display the calculated area and perimeter of the triangle.
6. If the triangle is not valid (e.g., the sum of two sides is less than or equal to the third side), the program will display "Invalid Values" for the area.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 to calculate areas and perimeters for other shapes.
8. You can enter new values and recalculate as many times as needed.

## Requirements

- .NET Framework (compatible with the version used in the code)
- Windows Operating System

## How it Works

- The program uses Windows Forms to create a user interface with input fields and buttons.
- When the user clicks a button for a specific shape, corresponding event handlers are triggered.
- The event handlers retrieve the input values from the text boxes and perform the necessary calculations.
- The calculated values are then displayed in the respective labels on the form.

Feel free to use the Areas Calculator to quickly calculate the areas and perimeters of circles, rectangles, and triangles. Enjoy!
